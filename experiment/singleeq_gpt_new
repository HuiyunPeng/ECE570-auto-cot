Then the next two consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as \\( x + 2 \\) and \\( x + 4 \\).\n\nNow, we can set up the equation based on the sum of these three numbers:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 69\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[\n3x + 6 = 69\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract 6 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n3x = 63\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nx = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, the smallest of the three consecutive odd numbers is \\( \\boxed{21} \\).\n\nTo verify, the three consecutive odd numbers are 21, 23, and 25.
