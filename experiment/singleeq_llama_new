{"question": "Q: Sandy sold half of her comic books and then bought 6 more. She now has 13. How many did she begin with ?\nA:", "gold_ans": "14", "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sandy sold half of her comic books, which means she still has half of them. Let's call the number of comic books she originally had \"x\". Since she sold half, she has x/2 left. Then, she bought 6 more comic books. So, now she has x/2 + 6. We know that she now has 13 comic books. We can set up an equation: x/2 + 6 = 13. To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides: x/2 = 7. Then, we can multiply both sides by 2: x = 14.
