Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can think of each pair as a unique identifier.\n\nThe number of unique pairs of letters can be calculated as follows:\n\n10 (books) * 2^10 (possible pairs of letters) = 10 * 1024 = 10240\n\nHowever, this is not the smallest number of letters needed. Since each book can be represented by a single letter, we can replace each pair of letters with a single letter. In this case, the number of unique letters needed would be:\n\n10 (books) + 10 (unique pairs of letters) = 20\n\nHowever, this is not the smallest number of letters needed either.\n\nThink of it like a binary system. We have 10 books, and we can represent each book with a 4-bit binary code. This means we only need 4 bits (or 2 letters) to represent each book.

The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.\n\nSince the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, we can set up the equation: (1/2) * (w^2) = 70.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get: w^2 = 140.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get: w = \u221a140 \u2248 11.83 feet.\n\nSince the length of the original square piece is 'w + 4', the length is approximately 11.83 + 4 \u2248 15.83", "pred_ans": "", "wrap_que": "Q: A car finishes a journey in 20 hours at the speed of 60 km/hr.
