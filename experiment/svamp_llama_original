After giving some cards to Jeff, she had 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left. \n\nTo find out how many cards she gave to Jeff, let's first find out how many cards she gave away. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards she has now from the number of cards she had initially. For baseball cards: 309 - 415 = -106 (we can't give away more cards than we had, so this means we have to give away 106 cards to Jeff). However, it is given that she has 415 baseball cards now, so she must have given 106 cards to Jeff. For Ace cards: 356 - 415 = -59 (like the baseball cards, we can't give away more cards than we had, so this means we have to give away 59 cards to Jeff). For Ace cards, she must have given 59 cards to Jeff.\n\nNow, let's find out how many baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has left. For baseball cards: 415 - 106 = 309.
