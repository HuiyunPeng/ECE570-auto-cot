Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/\u221a3\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h \u2013 x = h - h/\u221a3.\n10 minutes = h *( 1 \u2013 1\u221a3)\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 \u2013 1\u221a3).\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/\u221a3, it takes :\nh = 10 / (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3)\nh / \u221a3 = 10/ \u221a3 * (1 \u2013 1/\u221a3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + \u221a3 ( conjugate of 1 - \u221a3). We get, x = h/\u221a3 = 10 (1 + \u221a3) / 2 = 5* (1 + \u221a3)\nSo, it takes 5(1 + \u221a3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\nAnswer : A", "correct": "A"}
