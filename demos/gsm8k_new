            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. There are three sisters, so we know that their ages sum to 16 \\times 3 = 48. We also know that one of the brothers is 12 years old, and that he is half the age of the older brother. That means that the older brother must be 24 years old. Now we have enough information to solve the problem. We know that the total age of all siblings is 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years old.",
