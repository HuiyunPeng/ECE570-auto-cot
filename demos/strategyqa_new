This would imply that Lord Voldemort was a student at Hogwarts while Professor Dumbledore was the Headmaster. However, we know from the Harry Potter series that Lord Voldemort was not a student at Hogwarts. He was expelled from the school when he was just a first year student. Therefore, we can conclude that Lord Voldemort was not taught by Professor Dumbledore.",
