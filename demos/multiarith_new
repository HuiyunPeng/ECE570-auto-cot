In the last round, she lost 48 points. So we subtract 48 from 49 and get 1. Therefore, she had 1 point at the end of the game.",

So, the cost of the roses is 5*6=30 dollars. There are 5 daisies, and each daisy costs 6 dollars. So, the cost of the daisies is 5*6=30 dollars. Then, we need to calculate the total cost.
